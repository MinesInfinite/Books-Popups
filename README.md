# 📘 Book Popups

Book Popups is a lightweight and configurable **Minecraft plugin** that allows servers to display **written books as pop-ups** when players join or during other in-game events.

The plugin is built with performance in mind and uses **NMS (Net Minecraft Server)** directly, avoiding the need for **ProtocolLib** and reducing server overhead.
